json entry wrapper class with the result
enum of the results

RuleDetector class
XSS Detector is a class built with detectors as optional args:
The detector reads each json entry and feeds the rule detectors in a general way.
prints according to the results. (enum with or).

The reading here will be regular (read the all file and just iterate thorught the array)
before feeding the detectors validae each entry. 

and in the sync we will talking about it as a stream oriented. (like a pcap file as an input).
ASK IN SYNC.

IdenticalRule10Sec
Stores:
a queue of jsons shared pointers.
a hash table with (user, password) -> host

each append:
	*) first check if there are password & user (if not just return false) 
	?) should the site be in the secured site? ASK IN SYNC.
	*) clean deprecated entries from the head. (more that 10 sec from the tail)
		*) use date library for time calculations. 10 sec should be class static property.. 
		*) also clean entires from the hash table.
	*) add new json to the list.
		*) if there is a collision & different hosts -> return true
	*) return false

main:
	build a new detector given a json file, passwords, secured sites
